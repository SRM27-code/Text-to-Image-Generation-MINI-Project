## Introduction

This mini-project focuses on generating images from text descriptions using advanced deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to explore the capabilities of neural networks in understanding and translating textual descriptions into visual representations.

## Features

- Convert textual descriptions into corresponding images
- Utilize state-of-the-art neural network architectures
- Easy-to-follow implementation
- Detailed documentation and examples

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-image-generation.git
cd text-to-image-generation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

### Generating Images

To generate images from text descriptions, run:

```bash
python generate.py --input "A description of the image you want to generate" --output output_image.png
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of pairs of textual descriptions and corresponding images. You can download the dataset from [here](link_to_dataset). Place the dataset in the `data/` directory:

```
text-to-image-generation/
└── data/
    ├── images/
    └── descriptions.txt
```

## Model

The model architecture is based on a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The training pipeline involves the following steps:

1. **Text Encoding**: Converting textual descriptions into embeddings.
2. **Image Generation**: Using GANs to generate images from text embeddings.
3. **Training**: Optimizing the model to improve the quality of generated images.

For more details on the model architecture and training process, refer to the [model documentation](docs/model.md).
